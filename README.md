Notes on survival and recurrent event analysis 

## Repo structure 

- `src` directory: code files 
- `.pre-commit-config.yaml`: config for use with `pre-commit`. It specifies what hooks to use. 
  Once this file is created, if you run `pre-commit install`, the pre-commit tool will populate the 
  `pre-commit` file in the `./.git/hooks` directory. Helpful references:

- `requirements.txt`: python packages used
